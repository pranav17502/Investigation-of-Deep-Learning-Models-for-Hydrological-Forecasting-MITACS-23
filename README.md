# Investigation of Deep Learning Models for Hydrological Forecasting

This repository contains code and documentation for a Mitacs project conducted at York University, Toronto, Canada, focused on leveraging deep learning models for hydrological forecasting and water quality analysis along the Grand River, Ontario.



## Project Overview

1. Conducted comprehensive Time Series, Multivariate, and Cross Correlation Analysis of river flow, rainfall, and water quality data (pH, conductivity, and DO) from multiple gauge stations along the Grand River, Ontario.

2. Utilized QGIS software to perform sophisticated geospatial analysis, unraveling spatial patterns and correlations among the gauge stations, providing valuable insights into the riverâ€™s dynamic behavior.

3. Employed advanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and integrated 24 previous hours' timestamps to predict river flow initially and later extended the models to forecast water quality parameters such as pH, DO, and water conductivity with lead times ranging from 1 to 24 hours.

4. Demonstrated expertise in environmental data analysis, cutting-edge time-series forecasting, and geospatial methodologies, contributing to better water resource management and sustainability practices.


## Key Features

1. Time Series Analysis
2. Multivariate Analysis
3. Cross Correlation Analysis
4. Geospatial Analysis using QGIS
5. LSTM-based Hydrological Forecasting
